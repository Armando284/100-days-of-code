# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 9, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Added function composition method to my terminal logs formatter project, it still doesn't work.

**Thoughts:** I am really struggling with function composition and `this` in TypeScript, but I am making progress, after much effort I have something that at least works similar to Chalk and that's amazing.

### Day 1: August 10, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Fixed function composition on my npm package for terminal styling.

**Thoughts:** It was really time consuming to find a way for the composition main function to work and get it's inner methods since those are added after creating the function with Object.defineProperty, the idea was to use a getter for each text style so it can grow and the builder pattern to join everything up.

### Day 2: August 11, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I did a bunch of Codewars exercises, "katas", those are quite fun. I am also starting an Angular survey app, questions will be related to programmers knowledge of JavaScript.

**Thoughts:** Even when katas are fun I think they are not as difficult as Leetcode or Hackerrank tests, also the difficulty ranking of the katas it's a bit weird there are 4kyu katas that are easier than 5kyu katas. Setting the environment for Angular from 0 it's quite difficult with bad internet, I hope people like the app and respond the questions in an honest way.

### Day 3: August 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I create the base of my Javascript level survey.

**Thoughts:** It's impressive how fast you can forget the things you don't practice all the time I needed to search the routing system of Angular and how to pass data from parent to children components. What a shame ðŸ˜ž. I want to add linting, angular material and deploy it to vercel when I am at a level I can show it to people.

# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Added function composition method to my terminal logs formatter project, it still doesn't work.

**Thoughts:** I am really struggling with function composition and `this` in TypeScript, but I am making progress, after much effort I have something that at least works similar to Chalk and that's amazing.
